## Introducing the challenge

The green transition is not just an environmental imperative but a complex socio-economic transformation. It involves transitioning from traditional energy sources to more sustainable ones, which is a significant challenge for our industrialized economies. While there is substantial political will and public support, the practical aspects of this transition are daunting. The complexity lies not just in developing new technologies but also in ensuring their adoption and integration into existing systems. Businesses, especially in the green tech sector, often struggle with the intricacies of procuring and implementing these non-standardized solutions. This complexity necessitates a paradigm shift in sales methodologies, with a growing need for consultative selling practices that can provide tailored guidance and support to each unique customer situation.

## A real-world example

The case of EV charging infrastructure deployment vividly illustrates these complexities. Typically, the journey from initial inquiry to installation commencement spans about 10 months – a duration that can be daunting for businesses and consumers alike. This process is not linear but a multi-faceted endeavor involving education, assessment, contracting, permitting, and finally, the installation of the physical infrastructure. Each step is rife with its own set of challenges and requires coordination with various stakeholders, including permitting agencies, utility companies, contractors, and end users. Such complexity often leads to delays, miscommunication, and, ultimately, a slower adoption rate of crucial green technologies.

## Generalizing the problem

The challenges seen in EV charging infrastructure are emblematic of broader issues faced across various green technology segments. Whether it’s solar energy implementation, smart energy management systems, or carbon capture technologies, the common threads include complexity, non-standardization, and a high demand for specialized information. These factors combine to create a daunting task for businesses looking to adopt green technologies. They must navigate a labyrinth of technical specifications, regulatory requirements, and logistical challenges, often without clear guidance. This situation creates a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of green technologies, which is crucial for achieving our environmental goals.

## The advent of LLM technology

### The potential of LLMs and RAG

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies presents a groundbreaking solution to these challenges. LLMs, powered by vast data and sophisticated algorithms, can process and analyze large volumes of complex information, providing contextually relevant responses. This capability is critical in managing the multifaceted aspects of green tech projects. RAG further enhances this by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with the ability to retrieve and incorporate external information. This means that the system can pull in the most recent data, regulatory updates, or technical information, ensuring that the guidance provided is not only context-aware but also up-to-date and accurate.

### The role of interactive AI

Interactive AI, with conversation as its core, promises a groundbreaking change in our technological interactions, introducing a level of agency and adaptability previously unfathomable. This AI not only understands and responds to queries but also anticipates needs, offering tailored solutions in real-time. It facilitates nuanced, context-sensitive dialogues, bridging the gap between complex technical specifications and practical application. This evolution in AI is not just a step forward; it’s a leap into a future where technology is an active, intelligent participant in the sales process, revolutionizing how businesses engage, decide, and innovate in the green technology sector.

### Our hypothesis

The advancements in LLM technology have reached a point where they can effectively address complex interaction problems in green technology adoption. One of the most significant challenges has been integrating various digital systems and interfaces, especially when dealing with public entities and multiple stakeholders. LLMs, particularly with prompt-based interactions, offer a solution to this challenge. These systems can adapt to the context of each user, simplifying the interface for information exchange. This adaptability is crucial for facilitating effective communication in project management, where various stakeholders often need to exchange technical and regulatory information. Moreover, the ability to use text-based communication, which is ubiquitous in professional settings, makes these systems highly accessible and efficient.

The use of AI agents to represent different stakeholders can transform the cumbersome direct communication process into a more streamlined, efficient system. These AI agents can autonomously interact with each other, managing the exchange of information and requirements. This shift can turn a complex many-to-many communication problem into a more manageable one-to-many scenario, with a central AI system coordinating the interactions. Furthermore, the application of AI in decision-making, especially for causal inference and error attribution, creates a feedback loop. This loop enables continuous learning and improvement in the process, making each subsequent project more efficient and less prone to errors.
